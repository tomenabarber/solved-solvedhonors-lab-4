The Problem The next step in our genetic algorithm creation is to select individuals on the basis of their ﬁtness. We could be selecting them for mutation, crossover, or the next generation. One selection method commonly used is called tournament selection. For tournament selection n individuals are randomly selected from the population, the k individuals with the highest ﬁtness values are returned. For example, tournament selection where k=2 and n=3 would randomly select 3 individuals from the population and return the 2 with the highest ﬁtness values. Your Task 1. Create a tournamentSelection function. The parameters for this function should be k, n, and the population. As output, it should return a list of n individuals. 1
